# BBsentials
THIS MOD IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH BINGO BREWERS ANYMORE since indigo had a problem with me focusing
on 1.20 and refusing to collaborate with me on request.

The mod is availibel on modrinth https://modrinth.com/mod/bbsentials

Worked on by 
Hype_the_Time/hackthetime (Main Developer)

Contributors:

hannibal2 (never made a push but was very helpful with questions and did some parts of the code)
nea89 (helped with gradle and the waypoint render)

IMPORTANT:
While this mod is supported for both 1.20.2 and 1.8.9 some features may be one version only. My (hackthetime) focus is on 1.20.2. Due too that some things may not be done in 1.8.9 by me personally.

1.20.2
I recommend using Fabulously Optimized together with this mod.
Some Features require at least Cit Resewn which is included there.

Cit resewn is by default configured to check the item for custom textures every tick.
Put it at least to 5 ticks or above (Cit Resewn in mod menu) to have FPS while in Inventories.

I worked together with ic22487, and he included a costume Splash Hub texture in his Hypixel+ texturepack.
(https://hypixel.net/threads/0-19-1-hypixel-for-1-8-1-12-and-1-20.4174260/)
If you don't want to use a Full texturepack there are texturepacks with only the hub ui and another with only Splash hub over in the release Section.

Depenendencies:
1.20.2: mod menu, cloth configManager, fabric api

1.8.9: nothing


**Do not expect any kind of support during Bingo times since those moderating it are likely to sweat it too.
If you have any kind of request**
