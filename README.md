# BingoBrewers1.20
The BingoBrewers mod for the newer versions of the game.
THIS MOD IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH BINGO BREWERS ANYMORE since indigo had a problem with me focusing
on 1.20 and refusing to collaborate with me on request. 

Worked on by 
Hype_the_Time alias HacktheTime (Developer)

IMPORTANT:
This mod is currently for 1.20.1 Fabric.

I recommend using Fabulously Optimized together with this mod.
Some Features require at least Cit Resewn which is included there.

Cit resewn is by default configured to check the item for custom textures every tick.
Put it at least to 5 ticks or above (Cit Resewn in mod menu) to have FPS while in Inventories.

I worked together with ic22487, and he included a costume Splash Hub texture in his Hypixel+ texturepack.
(https://hypixel.net/threads/0-19-1-hypixel-for-1-8-1-12-and-1-20.4174260/)
If you don't want to use a Full texturepack there are texturepacks with only the hub ui and another with only Splash hub over in the release Section.

**Do not expect any kind of support during Bingo times since those moderating it are likely to sweat it too.
If you have any kind of request**

You may apply for preannouce¹ if you have a good reason. (Normally people who did something good for the community like splashes,... Specific Bingo maniacs may get it too.)
Do this BEFORE Bingo starts! Bribing (already try) on any Side will Result in a permanent unappealable ban!






¹ preannounce has a slight advantage in timing. (15 sec early chchest) (Splash is notified in intervals of how much time you have left. Preannounce has a slight buff here.)
Splash announce order:
pre with less than 10 mins
everybody with less than 1 min splash
everybody with less than 10 splash
pre with less then 25 mins of splash
everybody else with less than 25 mins remaining
Discord and everybody
