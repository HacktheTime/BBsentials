# BBsentials
THIS MOD IS NOT AFFILIATED WITH BINGO BREWERS ANYMORE since indigo had a problem with me focusing
on 1.20 and refusing to collaborate with me on request.

The mod is availibel on modrinth https://modrinth.com/mod/bbsentials

Worked on by 
Hype_the_Time/hackthetime (Main Developer)

Contributors:

hannibal2 (never made a push but was very helpful with questions and did some parts of the code)

nea89 (helped with gradle and the waypoint render)

IMPORTANT:
While this mod is supported for both Recent and 1.8.9 some features may be one version only. My (hackthetime) focus is
on Recent. Due too that some things may not be done in 1.8.9 by me personally feel free to make Pull Requests for the
1.8.9 Code.

1.20.4
I recommend using Fabulously Optimized together with this mod.

Cit resewn is by default configured to check the item for custom textures every tick.
Put it at least to 5 ticks or above (Cit Resewn in mod menu) to have FPS while in Inventories.

Textures are usually by ic22487 but can be overriden by putting the textures at the correct path.

They have a full texture pack here.

Mod Dependencies:

Recent: mod menu, cloth config, fabric api

1.8.9: nothing

**Do not expect any kind of support during Bingo times since those developing and/or moderating this are likely to sweat
it just like you.
If you have any kind of request you can still try it though.**

The newest branch is usually hypeswap.
