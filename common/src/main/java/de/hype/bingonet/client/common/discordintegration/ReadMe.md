This package (Discord Integration)
HAS to be modified to your needs by yourself do not request any changes! **This package is excluded by the Rule to
always make a pull request!**.
You may modify it to your needs but do not exit this package with the code. Modifications on other code
(which is not the Discord Config class or the Modmenu Config Screen Class to allow adding own config options for the
DISCORD Integration) etc **is NOT excluded**
from that Rule. Like always abusive functions may result in a ban.
Sharing the modified version is always a risk for the users as well but is by default allowed to be shared via fork (at
least for now).
Everything must link back to the original repository. Taking Donations or uploading on platforms like Modrinth is
disallowed!
